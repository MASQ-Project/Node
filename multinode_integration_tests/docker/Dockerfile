# These lines are commented out because for some reason the installation of iptables-persistent hangs forever on
# bullseye-slim. Its absence means that the NodeStartupConfigBuilder::open_firewall_port() function won't work, but
# at the time of this comment it's used in only one place in a way that doesn't have any value. So we decided to
# comment that out and continue adding value rather than spending time getting this to work for no profit.
