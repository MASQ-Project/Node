# `test_utils`
Testing Utilities

## Purpose
The purpose of `test_utils` is to provide test utilities across all the subprojects in MASQ Node.

It is built as a library, and is not intended as a standalone program.
It probably isn't the most interesting place to begin digging into our code;
[node](https://github.com/MASQ-Project/Node/tree/master/node)
is a better place to start.
