    MASQ Node listens for connections from other Nodes using the computer's
    network interface. Configuring the internet router for port forwarding is a necessary
    step for Node users to permit network communication between Nodes.

    Once started, Node prints the node descriptor to the console. The descriptor
    indicates the required port needing to be forwarded by the network router. The port is
    the last number in the descriptor, as shown below:

    Steps To Forwarding Ports In The Router
        1. Log in to the router.
        2. Navigate to the router's port forwarding section, also frequently called virtual server.
        3. Create the port forwarding entries in the router."
