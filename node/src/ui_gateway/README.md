# `ui_gateway`
User-interface endpoint for MASQ Node

## Purpose
The purpose of `ui_gateway` is to provide a WebSockets server to which user-interface elements can 
connect, and a sink for commands and source for status data from and to such elements.

### Documentation
The UI-Interface Interface Documentation outlines all the current MASQNode-UIv2 messaging available across Websockets.
You can fine it [here](https://github.com/MASQ-Project/Node/blob/master/USER-INTERFACE-INTERFACE.md)


It probably isn't the most interesting place to begin digging into our code;
[node](https://github.com/MASQ-Project/Node/tree/master/node)
is a better place to start.
