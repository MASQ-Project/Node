# hopper
Micro routing for MASQ Network traffic

## Purpose
The purpose of `hopper` is to interpret CORES packages, determining their next destination --
either inside the current MASQ Node (i.e. to the ProxyServer or the ProxyClient)
or on to the next Node in its Route.

It probably isn't the most interesting place to begin digging into our code;
[node](https://github.com/MASQ-Project/Node/tree/master/node)
is a better place to start.
