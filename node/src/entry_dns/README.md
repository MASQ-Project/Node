# `entry_dns`
DNS service for MASQ Node

## Purpose
The purpose of `entry_dns` is to act as a very simple DNS (domain name service) which,
together with the DNS subversion provided by `dns_utility`,
enables TCP traffic to be directed into the MASQ Node software without
configuration changes to client software.

It probably isn't the most interesting place to begin digging into our code;
[node](https://github.com/MASQ-Project/Node/tree/master/node)
is a better place to start.
