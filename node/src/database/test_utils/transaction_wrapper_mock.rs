// Trying to store a rusqlite 'Statement' inside the TransactionWrapperMock and then placing this
// combination into the ConnectionWrapperMock placed us before complex lifetime issues. A hypothesis
// is that because of the design of the language maintaining such relationships between objects
// may be unachievable.

// Eventually, we decided to take a different approach: radically reduce the excessive use of
// borrowed references. We had to make the mock much smarter by giving it its own db connection,
// or in some cases two. This connection acts as a source for creating native rusqlite Statements.
// This was unavoidable because we couldn't find any alternative to having the rusqlite library
// build the 'Statement' using their internal methods. Additionally, our attempts to create
// a StatementWrapper failed due to solid compilation problems. These problems were caused by
// the way generic arguments are spread across the methods in the 'Statement' implementation,
// out of which quite a lot of them are being used by us. It couldn't be replicated in our wrapper.
// In Rust, no one may write a trait with generic arguments in its methods as long as a trait object
// is to be formed.

// With that said, we're relieved to have at least one working solution now. Speaking of the 'prepare'
// method, an error would be hardly needed because the production code simply unwraps the results by
// using 'expect'. That is a function excluded from the requirement of writing tests for.

// The 'Statement' produced by this method must be better understood. The 'prepare' method has
// a crucial influence on the result of the following function, executing such prepared 'Statement'.
// Luckily, we can steer the course of events that this next function call will have to go through,
// able to anticipate, and therefore count on an exact result to happen during the test. This approach
// can be applied for every related method such as 'execute', 'query_row', or 'query_map'.
