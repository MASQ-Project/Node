     zero-hop.\n\n\
     originate-only means that your Node will not accept connections from any other Node; it \
     will only originate connections to other Nodes. This will reduce your Node's opportunity to route \
     data (it will only ever have two neighbors, so the number of routes it can participate in is limited), \
     it will reduce redundancy in the MASQ Network, and it will prevent your Node from acting as \
     a connection point for other Nodes to get on the Network; but it will enable your Node to operate in \
     an environment where your network hookup is preventing you from accepting connections, and it means \
     that you don't have to forward any incoming ports through your router. --ip and --clandestine_port \
     are incompatible with --neighborhood_mode originate-only.\n\n\
     consume-only means that your Node will not accept connections from or route data for any other Node; \
     it will only consume services from the MASQ Network. This mode is appropriate for devices that \
     cannot maintain a constant IP address or stay constantly on the Network. --ip and --clandestine_port \
     are incompatible with --neighborhood_mode consume-only.\n\n\
     standard means that your Node will operate fully unconstrained, both originating and accepting \
     connections, both consuming and providing services, and when you operate behind a router, it \
     requires that you forward your clandestine port through that router to your Node's machine.";
pub const MAPPING_PROTOCOL_HELP: &str =

    through it to your machine. These three protocols are pcp, pmp, and igdp. The Node can try them one \
    by one to determine which your router supports, but if you happen to know already, you can supply the \
    name of the protocol here. If you've taken care of port mapping in some other way, \
    and you don't need Node to negotiate with your router, say 'none' here and be sure to specify your \
    public IP address with the --ip parameter. If the Node communicates successfully with your router, \
    it will remember the protocol it used, and on its next run it will try that protocol first, unless \
    you specify a different protocol on the command line.";
pub const MIN_HOPS_HELP: &str =
    "The Node is a system that routes data through multiple Nodes to enhance security and privacy. \
    However, the level of anonymity and security provided depends on the number of hops specified \
    by the user. By default, the system allows the user to customize the number of hops within a \
    range of 1 to 6.\n\n\
    It's important to note that if the user selects less than 3 hops, the anonymity of their data \
    cannot be guaranteed. Here's a breakdown of the different hop counts and their implications:\n\n\
    1. A 1-hop route means that the exit Node will know the IP address of the originating Node. \
    Also, someone snooping traffic on the network will be able to see both the originating Node's IP \
    and the exit Node's IP in the same packet. A 1-hop route makes MASQ the equivalent of a VPN. \n\
    2. A 2-hop route removes the ability to see both the originating and exit IP addresses on the \
    same packet, but it means that the relay Node in the middle (which could be subverted by an attacker) \
    knows both IP addresses.\n\
    3. A 3-hop route is the shortest route that prevents any Node in the network (even the originating Node) \
    from knowing the IP addresses of all the Nodes in the route.\n\
    4. Increasing the number of hops to 4, 5, or 6 can enhance security, but it will also \
    increase the cost and latency of the route.\n\
    If you want to specify a minimum hops count, you can do so by entering a number after the \
    '--min-hops' parameter. For example, '--min-hops 4' would require at least 4 hops. If you fail \
    to provide this argument, the system will default to a minimum hops count of 3.";
pub const REAL_USER_HELP: &str =

     run with root privilege after bootstrapping, you might want to use this if you start the Node as root, or if \
     you start the Node using pkexec or some other method that doesn't populate the SUDO_xxx variables. Use a value \

    recorded, and for delinquent Nodes that need to be banned. If you don't specify this parameter, or if you give \
    it the value 'on', these scans will proceed normally. But if you give the value 'off', the scans won't be \
    started when the Node starts, and will have to be triggered later manually and individually with the \
    MASQNode-UIv2 'scan' command. (If you don't, you'll most likely be delinquency-banned by all your neighbors.) \
    This parameter is most useful for testing.";
pub const RATE_PACK_HELP: &str = "\

pub const PAYMENT_THRESHOLDS_HELP: &str = "\
     These are parameters that define thresholds to determine when and how much to pay other Nodes for routing and \
     exit services and the expectations the Node should have for receiving payments from other Nodes for routing and \
     exit services. The thresholds are also used to determine whether to offer services to other Nodes or enact a ban \
     since they have not paid mature debts. These are ever present values, no matter if the user's set any value, as \
     they have defaults. The parameters must be always supplied all together, delimited by vertical bars and in the right \
     order.\n\n\
     1. Debt Threshold gwei: Payables higher than this -- in gwei of MASQ -- will be suggested for payment immediately \
     upon passing the Maturity Threshold Sec age. Payables less than this can stay unpaid longer. Receivables higher than \
     this will be expected to be settled by other Nodes, but will never cause bans until they pass the Maturity Threshold Sec \
     + Payment Grace Period Sec age. Receivables less than this will survive longer without banning.\n\n\
     2. Maturity Threshold Sec: Large payables can get this old -- in seconds -- before the Accountant's scanner suggests \
     that it be paid.\n\n\
     3. Payment Grace Period Sec: A large receivable can get as old as Maturity Threshold Sec + Payment Grace Period Sec \
     -- in seconds -- before the Node that owes it will be banned.\n\n\
     4. Permanent Debt Allowed gwei: Receivables this small and smaller -- in gwei of MASQ -- will not cause bans no \
     matter how old they get.\n\n\
     5. Threshold Interval Sec: This interval -- in seconds -- begins after Maturity Threshold Sec for payables and after \
     Maturity Threshold Sec + Payment Grace Period Sec for receivables. During the interval, the amount of a payable that is \
     allowed to remain unpaid, or a pending receivable that won’t cause a ban, decreases linearly from the Debt Threshold gwei \
     to Permanent Debt Allowed gwei or Unban Below gwei.\n\n\
     6. Unban Below gwei: When a delinquent Node has been banned due to non-payment, the receivables balance must be paid \
     below this level -- in gwei of MASQ -- to cause them to be unbanned. In most cases, you'll want this to be set the same \
     as Permanent Debt Allowed gwei.";
pub const SCAN_INTERVALS_HELP:&str = "\
     These three intervals describe the length of three different scan cycles running automatically in the background \
     since the Node has connected to a qualified neighborhood that consists of neighbors enabling a complete 3-hop \
     route. Each parameter can be set independently, but by default are all the same which currently is most desirable \
     for the consistency of service payments to and from your Node. Technically, there doesn't have to be any lower \
     limit for the minimum of time you can set; two scans of the same sort would never run at the same time but the \
     next one is always scheduled not earlier than the end of the previous one. These are ever present values, no matter \
     if the user's set any value, they have defaults. The parameters must be always supplied all together, delimited by vertical \
     bars and in the right order.\n\n\
     1. Pending Payable Scan Interval: Amount of seconds between two sequential cycles of scanning for payments that are \
     marked as currently pending; the payments were sent to pay our debts, the payable. The purpose of this process is to \
     confirm the status of the pending payment; either the payment transaction was written on blockchain as successful or \
     failed.\n\n\
     2. Payable Scan Interval: Amount of seconds between two sequential cycles of scanning aimed to find payable accounts \
     of that meet the criteria set by the Payment Thresholds; these accounts are tracked on behalf of our creditors. If \
     they meet the Payment Threshold criteria, our Node will send a debt payment transaction to the creditor in question.\n\n\
     3. Receivable Scan Interval: Amount of seconds between two sequential cycles of scanning for payments on the \

             same packet, but it means that the relay Node in the middle (which could be subverted by an attacker) \
             knows both IP addresses.\n\
             3. A 3-hop route is the shortest route that prevents any Node in the network (even the originating Node) \
             from knowing the IP addresses of all the Nodes in the route.\n\
             4. Increasing the number of hops to 4, 5, or 6 can enhance security, but it will also \
             increase the cost and latency of the route.\n\
             If you want to specify a minimum hops count, you can do so by entering a number after the \
             '--min-hops' parameter. For example, '--min-hops 4' would require at least 4 hops. If you fail \
             to provide this argument, the system will default to a minimum hops count of 3."
